# Chill - When is Your Shower Ready?  

As part of the capstone project at Penn State for ESC 460W:  
This project aims to automate the piping in a shower to both conserve normally wasted water, and to alert the user when their shower has reached a desired temperature.  
  
This code repository contains the code which runs on Arduinos and attached ESP8266 WiFi chips. Each Arduino and WiFi chip communicate wirelessly between each other and between an iPhone application. The code is responsible for relaying messages between the iPhone app and the valves, and for maintaining a state machine on how the valves should be operating.
